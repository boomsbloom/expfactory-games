# Experiment Factory Games

Experiment Factory Games are currently under development, a collaboration between Vinod Menon's Lab (Jonathan and Christian) and Poldracklab (Vanessa) toward a vision of fun, modern paradigms.

### Standards Under Development
- main game file should be called Run.js
- boolean variable "finished" included with every trial (0 to continue/1 to finish)

For the config.json specifications, please see our [documentation](http://expfactory.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#config-json)
